In this folder i will store my variants of CS50 problems solving.

Im very new in programming, so following code can be ugly, slow, full of brute force and strange constructions.

In most cases im trying to complete task before watching tips and walkthroughs, 
so my code can be different from expected and far not optimal, but the output will fit the problem conditions.
